Unix `cat` broke on my Mac. I think the /bin/cat file got corrupted or
something.  Since I didn't have access to another Mac running the same OS to
mirror it from, I decided to just write my own cat. Should be simple, right?

Accepts no flags. (But who uses cat flags anyway?)

Includes both a POSIX and a C stdlib variant.
